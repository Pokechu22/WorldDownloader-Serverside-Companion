  This plugin provides a set of permissions that control what WorldDownloader
  (a mod that downloads a Minecraft world on a server; also known as WDL) may
  download.


commands: 
  wdl: 
    aliases: [worlddownloader]
    usage: |
      /<command> updateme -- update your WDL permissions (if the server's ones changed) 
      /<command> reload -- reload the config.
      /<command> request ... -- request permissions.
      /<command> update <player> -- update a player's WDL permissions.
      /<command> updateall -- update the WDL permissions of all online players.
      /<command> requests ... -- view and aprove permission requests.
    

permissions:
  #Utility permissions.
  wdl.reloadConfig: 
    default: op
    description: 
      If a player has this permission, they can use "/wdl reload" to manually
      reload the configuration without restarting the server.
  wdl.updatePlayer: 
    default: op
    description: 
      If a player has this permission, they can use "/wdl update" to update a
      different player's permissions.  (Any player can use "/wdl updateme" to
      update their own permissions, even without this permission).  This perm
      also allows access to "/wdl updateall".
  wdl.handleRequests:
    default: op
    description:
      If a player has this permission, they can use "/wdl requests" to manage
      permission requests from other players on this server (or, if it is set
      up, other servers in this bungeecord cluster).
  #Override permissions
  wdl.overrideCanDoNewThings: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to use functions that
      are not known to this plugin regardless of the value of what is set for
      "wdl.canDoNewThings" in the config.
  wdl.overrideCanDownloadInGeneral: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to download the world
      regardless of the value of "wdl.canDownloadInGeneral" in the config.
  wdl.overrideSaveRadius: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to download chunks at
      the full server chunk view distance regardless of what the config value
      is for "wdl.saveRadius".  (Note that this is only used if the player is
      not allowed to cache chunks!)
  wdl.overrideCanCacheChunks: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to cache chunks (thus
      allowing them to save the entire map easily) regardless of the value of
      "wdl.canCacheChunks" in the config.
  wdl.overrideCanSaveEntities: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to save entities such
      as animals, monsters, and minecart chests throughout the map regardless
      of the value of the config setting "wdl.canSaveEntities".
  wdl.overrideCanSaveTileEntities: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, they are allowed to save tile entities
      (additional metadata about blocks such as sign text, chest contents, or
      banner appearance) as they move about the world, regardless of what the
      config's setting "wdl.canSaveTileEntities" says.  This only covers tile
      entities that do not require a player to open a GUI to receive the data
      (so chests and similar containers require a second permission, which is
      useless without this one -- "wdl.overrideCanSaveContainers").
  wdl.overrideCanSaveContainers: 
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has both this permission and the more general permission of
      "wdl.overrideCanSaveContainers", they can save the contents of all tile
      entities that require opening to load the contents (containers) such as
      chests, furnaces, hoppers, brewing stands, and beacons, even if such is
      disabled in the config with "wdl.canSaveContainers" set to "false".
  wdl.overrideSendEntityRanges:
    default: op
    description: |
      If a player has this permission, and the server runs spigot, the ranges
      at which various entities are tracked will be sent to them.  The config
      explains why WDL needs this data.  The player must also have permission
      to save entities (wdl.overrideCanSaveEntities) for this to take effect.
