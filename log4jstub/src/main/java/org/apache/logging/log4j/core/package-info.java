/**
 * Wondering why I have a bunch of log4j core stubs? The answer is
 * compatibility; I need to compile against both log4j 2.0-beta9 and 2.8.1.
 * Since I'm using internals, there are plenty of acceptable breaking changes I
 * need to cope with, and I need to be able to link with either.
 *
 * Log4j is licensed under the Apache license, Version 2.0; these packages do
 * not contain any log4j code, though.
