# WorldDownloader Serverside Companion plugin
Companion bukkit plugin for [the WorldDownloader mod](https://github.com/Pokechu22/WorldDownloader) that gives control over what can be downloaded.

If this plugin is not installed, WorldDownloader assumes that it can download everything; you can use this plugin if you want to limit WDL's capabilities.
